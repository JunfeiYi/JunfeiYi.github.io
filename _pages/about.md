Hello, I'm Junfei. Welcome to my homepage.

I was born in 1997 and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the National Engineering Center of Robot Visual Perception and Control Technology, Hunan University, under the supervision of [Professor Yaonan Wang](https://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1277/4490.htm), [Professor Jianxu Mao](https://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1404/4625.htm), and [Professor Hui Zhang](https://robotics.hnu.edu.cn/info/1071/1538.htm). I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees from Changsha University of Science and Technology in 2021 and Xiâ€™an University of Posts & Telecommunications in 2018, respectively.  

From February 2024 to February 2025, I am a visiting researcher at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), working under the supervision of [Professor Xiaojun Chang](https://www.xiaojun.ai/) and [Dr. Hanyu Gu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Hanyu.Gu).
